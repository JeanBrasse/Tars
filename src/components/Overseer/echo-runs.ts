 * says that question went unanswered, which a count at the top of the thread
 * cannot. Nothing is dropped - every message stays in the run it belongs to and
 * the fold opens onto all of them.
 *
 * The role is tested alongside the flag rather than trusted. Nothing marks a
 * user message today, and the flag is computed rather than stored, but folding
 * is the one thing that must never happen to a line Noah typed, so the rule
 * that protects it is written where it is relied on instead of being inherited
 * from how the reader currently happens to behave.
