 * nothing about whose wait this is. The 4x4 grid is the app icon, the sidebar
 * mark and the launch screen already, so a wait that shows it is recognisably
 * Tars working rather than a generic pause.
 *
 * One light travels the grid in reading order: the top-left cell, then along
 * that row, then back to the left of the row below, and so on. Each cell runs
 * the `square-sweep` keyframes delayed by its own index, so all sixteen are
 * distinct. It used to be `(col + row) mod 4`, which gives only four delays
 * and lights a whole diagonal at a time. Unlit cells rest at 0.16 rather than
 * disappearing, which is what keeps the silhouette readable.
 * Frame: `Loading states`.
