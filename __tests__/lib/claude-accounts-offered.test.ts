/**
 * The renderer's half of keeping Claude accounts off on Windows: on a Windows build
 * Settings does not offer Claude accounts until they are ported. Main's half,
 * which keeps the option off whatever the registry says, is
 * electron/claude-accounts/windows-off.test.ts.
 *
 * How it fails, written before the code:
 * 1. The Settings sidebar (and its narrow-screen select) lists Claude accounts
 *    on win32, so a user turns on something that cannot sign in.
 * 2. A link to /settings?section=claude-accounts opens the section on win32.
 * 3. Over-correction: a Mac or Linux window loses the entry or the link, or
 *    another section goes missing on win32.
