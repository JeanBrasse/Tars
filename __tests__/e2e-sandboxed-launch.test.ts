/**
 * The e2e suite starts the app only through launchSandboxed.
 *
 * HOME never moved Electron's profile. Launched with HOME alone, every e2e run
 * until 2026-09-16 opened ~/Library/Application Support/tars, which on a
 * case-insensitive disk is the installed Tars's own profile, while that app was
 * running. launchSandboxed in e2e/fixture.mjs moves the profile and then asks the
 * running app where its folders landed, so it cannot be fooled by a flag that
 * stopped working; what it cannot do is catch a spec that never calls it. This
 * does: a direct `.launch(` anywhere in e2e/ is a spec reaching past the sandbox.
