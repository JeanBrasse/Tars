/**
 * What an agent's MCP tool says when Tars does not answer: apiRequest
 * (mcp-shared/src/tars-api.ts), which mcp-orchestrator and mcp-memory call Tars
 * with. It said "This operation was aborted" after 30 s, where mcp-kanban says
 * "Tars did not answer at <origin>: no answer within 60 s" (QA's gate of #196).
 *
 * How this can fail, written before the code:
 * 1. it does not say that Tars is what did not answer, nor how long it waited;
 * 2. it names a delay it did not wait: the 30 s default for a call that gave its
 *    own (wait_for_agent's segments, delegate_task's run);
 * 3. it stops being an AbortError: delegate_task reads that name as its own wait
 *    running out, and anything else sends it on to type the task into the
 *    agent's terminal as well, so the task runs twice;
 * 4. it says Tars did not answer when Tars did: an answer in time, an error
 *    Tars returned, or a connection refused, each is reported as what it is;
 * 5. an answer whose headers came and whose body stopped is waited on for ever,
 *    or said another way.
 *
 * A real server on a free port stands in for Tars and holds what it is told to
 * hold. Each call gives its own delay, in milliseconds, so nothing here waits
 * 30 s: the contract (__tests__/mcp/contracts) replays the defaults in the
 * built servers.
