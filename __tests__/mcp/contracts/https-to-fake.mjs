/**
 * Preloaded into a server under contract (`node --import`): every HTTPS call it

 * plain HTTP, with the host it asked for in `x-contract-host`.
 *
 * The servers import `https` as an ES namespace, so the patched functions are
 * pushed into it with syncBuiltinESMExports. Nothing else is changed: the
 * server builds its request as it always does, and this only moves where it
 * lands.
