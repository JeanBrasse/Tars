/**
 * A kanban tool does not wait on a Tars that stopped answering.
 *
 * mcp-kanban asks Tars for everything, and its request had no timeout: a Tars
 * that hangs (a stuck main process, a gateway call that never returns) left the
 * tool waiting until the MCP client gave up, with nothing to tell the agent.
 * The Backend's gate of #171.
 *
 * How this can fail, written before the code:
 * 1. the request sets no timeout, so a silent Tars is waited on for ever;
 * 2. a timeout that fires does not end the request, or ends it without saying Tars did not answer.
 *
 * The transport is replaced and nothing else: the real client builds the
 * request, and these read what it asked for and what it does when the socket
 * times out. Nothing reaches a Tars.
