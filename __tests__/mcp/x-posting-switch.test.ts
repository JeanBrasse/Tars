/**
 * The X server posts only while Posting is on in Settings > X (Twitter).
 *
 * The switch has been on the Settings page, off by default, since the X server
 * shipped, and nothing read it: every agent handed `x_post_tweet`,
 * `x_reply_tweet` and `x_delete_tweet` could publish and delete on Noah's
 * account whatever the page said (the audit's lead #12). The privacy policy
 * says Tars posts only when Noah has turned it on.
 *
 * How this can fail, written before the fix:
 * 1. with Posting off, a post, a reply or a delete goes out anyway;
 * 2. a settings file written before the switch existed, which has no value for it, posts;
 * 3. a value that is not the switch's own `true` (the string "true", a 1) turns posting on;
 * 4. the switch is read once: turned off after the server started, posting goes on, and turned on, it stays refused;
 * 5. a settings file that cannot be read lets the call through;
 * 6. a refused call still reaches the network, because the check comes after the request;
 * 7. with Posting on, the call no longer reaches X at all: the fix refuses everything.
 *
 * The tools are the real ones, registered on a server that keeps their
 * handlers. The network is a recorder: nothing here reaches X.
