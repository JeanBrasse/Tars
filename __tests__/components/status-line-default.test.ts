 * No status line choice nobody made (1.7.4).

 * The main process leaves `statusLineEnabled` out of its defaults on purpose:
 * unset means the switch was never touched, and the status line keeps the
 * behaviour it has for someone who never opened Settings. The renderer's
 * defaults said `false`, which reads as a decision the moment anything sends
 * these settings back whole. Settings only sends the delta today, so nothing
 * shows; this holds the renderer to the same absence as the main process.
