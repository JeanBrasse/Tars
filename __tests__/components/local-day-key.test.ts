/**
 * Which calendar day a chart bar belongs to.
 *
 * The chart labelled its bars with the LOCAL date and looked their money up by
 * the UTC date. East of Greenwich those differ for part of every day, so every
 * bar carried the previous day's spend under the current day's label - and the
 * "latest day" card, which looks the day up by its own key, disagreed with the
 * bar the user was hovering. Reported as "$254.14 in LATEST DAY but $446.20 in
 * the chart for 23 August"; $446.20 was the 22nd.
 *
 * These assertions run against the helper the Usage page actually calls, so a
 * regression to toISOString() in src/app/usage/page.tsx fails here.
