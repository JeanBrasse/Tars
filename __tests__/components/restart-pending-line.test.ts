/**
 * The line a panel shows while a changed setting waits to restart its agent
 * (#150). Written by the QA after the Audit's Low on #150: its renderer logic
 * had no test of its own (#131's rule).
 *
 * How this can fail:
 * 1. a wait reads as another one, or falls through to the generic sentence,
 *    and the person at the keyboard is told to wait when they are the one to act;
 * 2. a setting is shown under its code name (`permissionMode`) instead of its word;
 * 3. several settings run together without their `and`;
 * 4. no setting at all leaves an empty "for :".
