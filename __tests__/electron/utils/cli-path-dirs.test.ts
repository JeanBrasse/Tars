/**
 * The four hand-written key lists, and what they had stopped agreeing on.
 *
 * Every caller that builds an agent's PATH needed the same set and each spelled
 * it out. They drifted, and the drift was invisible: a binary the user had
 * configured in Settings simply never reached the PATH of an agent started
 * from one of the paths that had forgotten it.
 *
 * These are the four as they stood at dcbd87e, the commit before this one.
 * They are here as the historical record, not as a fixture: the point of the
 * suite is that nothing they covered was lost, and that has to be checked key
 * by key rather than by a count.
