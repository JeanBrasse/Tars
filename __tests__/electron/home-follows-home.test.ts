/**
 * No part of the main process finds the home directory through Electron.
 *
 * On macOS app.getPath('home') ignores HOME: measured on 2026-09-16, with HOME
 * on a temp directory it still answered /Users/noah, where os.homedir()
 * answered the temp directory. Everything that isolates a Tars (the sandbox
 * script, the e2e, a test) does it with HOME, so each such call was a way for
 * an isolated Tars to reach the real account: seven of them, handing agents the
 * real ~/.claude/mcp.json and writing a prompt file into the real ~/.dorothy.
 * Seven sites on one cause is a class, so the cause is what is checked.
 *
 * Read from disk with fs rather than with grep: a grep that skips binary files
 * would return nothing for a file it never read, and nothing is the answer
 * this test wants.
