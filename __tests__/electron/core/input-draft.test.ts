/**
 * The model of what is in an agent's input field, rebuilt from the keys Tars
 * relays into it.
 *
 * It exists so a message can be kept out of a half-written prompt, which
 * means the only thing that matters about it is where it says "I know" and
 * where it says "I do not": a wrong "I know" clears a field Tars cannot put
 * back, and that is worse than never delivering anything. So most of what is
 * below is the giving-up half.
 *
 * Every behaviour asserted here was measured against Claude Code 2.1.273 in a
 * real PTY, keys sent as xterm sends them, each submission read from its
 * UserPromptSubmit hook. The measurements are quoted in input-draft.ts.
