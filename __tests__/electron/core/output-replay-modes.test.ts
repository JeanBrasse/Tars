/**
 * A panel that replays an agent's kept output starts in the modes the CLI left
 * set, however much of the output was trimmed.
 *
 * Found by the Frontend on #101: after a long turn with no input, a Claude Code
 * panel remounted at the same size no longer passed the wheel on. agent.output
 * keeps 600 chunks and trims to 400, and Claude Code 2.1.273 in fullscreen
 * writes the alternate screen, bracketed paste, focus events and the hidden
 * cursor once, at start. The mouse request comes back on a key or a resize,
 * never during a turn. Measured on a real session: 649 chunks and not one mode
 * over a four and a half minute turn, and after the trim that took the start
 * the replay began on the normal screen, with no mouse request and no bracketed
 * paste, which xterm needs to send a paste as a paste rather than as lines.
 *
 * Every case goes through appendAgentOutput, the function the five PTY
 * handlers call, and reads the chunks a panel would replay.
