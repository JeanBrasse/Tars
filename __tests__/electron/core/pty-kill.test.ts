/**
 * Killing a terminal on Windows raises no error (audit A22, matrix row 17).
 *
 * node-pty 1.1 ends a ConPTY terminal by forking conpty_console_list_agent.js
 * with the shell's pid to list the processes on its console. That helper
 * throws `AttachConsole failed` when the shell has no console any more: every
 * kill of a terminal whose shell has exited. Reproduced before this was
 * written, Windows 11 26200, node-pty 1.1.0: 3 of 3 exited cmd.exe, under
 * Node 22 and under Electron 44. Five seconds later node-pty kills the dead
 * shell's pid anyway, which Windows may have given to another process.
 *
 * How it fails, written before the code (2026-09-25):
 * 1. darwin/linux: anything but pty.kill(), or node-pty's internals read.
 * 2. win32, the shell has exited: the list helper is forked anyway (and
 *    throws AttachConsole failed), or a pid is killed from a stale list.
 * 3. win32, the shell runs: the processes on its console are not listed and
 *    ended as node-pty ends them, or the helper's output reaches Tars's own.
 * 4. win32, the helper fails without a list (the shell exited meanwhile):
 *    the shell's pid is killed regardless, as node-pty's five second fallback
 *    does, instead of nothing.
 * 5. win32, the helper never answers: nothing is ended, or the shell's pid is
 *    ended after the shell has exited.
 * 6. win32, a terminal that is not ConPTY through the inbox console (winpty,
 *    useConptyDll, a node-pty of another shape): altered, or not killed.
 * 7. win32, the helper cannot be forked at all: the kill throws, or the
 *    terminal is left running.
 * 8. For real, 10 exited and 10 running ConPTY terminals killed: an
 *    AttachConsole failure, an uncaught exception, a running shell left, or a
 *    list helper left running. The same run with a plain pty.kill() must show
 *    the failure, or the case proves nothing.
 *
 * Added at win-reviewer's gate (2026-09-25), written before the fix:
 * 9. A node-pty other than 1.1.x, or one whose version cannot be read, has
 *    its internals touched on the strength of their names alone, where it
 *    must get node-pty's own kill().
 *
 * Added after CI run 36240513885 (2026-09-26), where the vitest worker of
 * another file died mid-file while case 8 ran beside it:
 * 10. Case 8's own negative witness lets node-pty kill the ids of ten exited
 *    shells five seconds on, ids Windows may have handed to any process by
 *    then (on the runner, an administrator: anything). The harness records
 *    those kills and sends none, and asserts them: node-pty's plain kill()
 *    does send one per exited shell, killPty() sends none.
 * 11. (run 36247263165) Three of the ten running shells answered their id at
 *    the one reading, 7 s after the kill: still running, or ids Windows had
 *    already handed to other processes. The harness reads each shell's
 *    creation time before the kill, and waits up to 20 s more for every
 *    shell that is still that process to go; an id held by a process created
 *    since is not the shell, and is reported, not counted.
 *
 * Added for the quit that hangs (win-qa, 2026-09-27), written before the code.
 * Measured with Electron 44 and node-pty 1.1.0, electron.exe started directly
 * with 6 ConPTY terminals, idle: ended at before-quit the way the app ends them,
 * the main process outlived its `exit` event until it was killed 15 s later in
 * 7 quits of 8 (1 clean); not ended at all, 7 of 8 exited in 60 ms and 1
 * crashed (0xC0000005); ended, then quit only once every shell's exit had
 * reached the app, 8 of 8 exited in under 200 ms, nothing left running. In the
 * app itself, 8 of 16 idle quits ended in 0xC0000409 and Windows Error Reporting.
 * The shell exits a moment after its pseudo console is closed, and node-pty's
 * exit thread then calls into a Node that Electron is tearing down.
 * holdExitUntilTerminalsExit is what the quit calls after ending the terminals:
 * 12. darwin/linux: anything is held or registered, or node-pty is read.
 * 13. win32, no terminal left to wait for (none ended, or each already
 *     exited, or not node-pty 1.1's inbox ConPTY): the quit is held.
 * 14. win32: the app exits (will-quit goes through, or app.exit is called)
 *     before every terminal it waits for has reported its exit.
 * 15. win32: once they have, the app does not exit, or exits more than once.
 * 16. win32: a terminal that never reports holds the quit for ever; past
 *     the bound the app exits all the same, and says so.
