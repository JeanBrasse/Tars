/**
 * What Tars does on its way out, and in what order.
 *
 * Two of the eight steps are the only chance the app has to put something on
 * disk: `saveAgents()` and `flushBus()`. The bus journal writes once per turn
 * of the event loop rather than once per row, so at the moment of the quit it
 * holds a turn's worth of the Chat in memory and nowhere else. `flushBus()`
 * was the fifth statement of a plain sequence: whether it ran at all was
 * decided by four calls that had no reason to throw, which is not the same as
 * cannot, and nothing in the app would have said so if one started to.
 *
 * Two assertions, because either alone can be satisfied while the defect
 * stands: the steps are each caught, and the two that write go first. The
 * second is read off main.ts's syntax tree, since a `before-quit` handler
 * cannot be called from here without an Electron app around it.
