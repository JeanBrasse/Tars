/**
 * A task delegated over ACP calls back the Tars that started it.
 *
 * Every agent terminal is told which one that is: spawnAgentPty sets
 * CLAUDE_MGR_API_URL after the caller's environment, precisely so no spawn
 * site has to remember. This path is not a terminal and did not set it, so the
 * run's hooks and its MCP servers fell back to the compiled default of 31415.
 * The QA measured it on 2026-09-20 while running on 31493: three posts from
 * its ACP child reached the live app and were refused as `Agent not found`.
 * Nothing was written, but the port is the boundary between a sandbox and
 * Noah's own app, and on this path it was not one.
 *
 * The port is fixed before the imports below, because `constants.ts` reads
 * DOROTHY_API_PORT once at module load. The fake agent process reports what it
 * and its MCP servers were actually handed.
