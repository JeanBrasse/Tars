/**
 * An error report from Windows keeps the home folder and the user name out,
 * as one from macOS does (error-report-shape.test.ts, #221).
 *
 * The report's scrub knew a home spelled one way, `/Users/somebody`, and took
 * the user name as what follows its last `/`. A Windows home is
 * `C:\Users\somebody`, and it reaches an error in more than one spelling.
 *
 * How it fails, written before the code (2026-09-28):
 * 1. The user name is never taken out on its own: split on `/`, the whole
 *    `C:\Users\somebody` is taken for it, so `somebody@DESKTOP-1` or
 *    `DESKTOP-1\somebody` in a message leaves the name.
 * 2. The home spelled with forward slashes, as a file URL and an ES module's
 *    stack frame write it (`file:///C:/Users/somebody/...`), leaves whole.
 * 3. The home with its backslashes doubled, as a path quoted in JSON
 *    (`"C:\\Users\\somebody"` in a JSON.parse message), leaves whole.
 * 4. The home URL-encoded (`C%3A%5CUsers%5Csomebody`) leaves whole.
 * 5. Any case: `c:\users\SOMEBODY` leaves.
 * 6. Over-correction: a macOS or Linux home gets other spellings, and its
 *    reports change (error-report-shape.test.ts holds them as they were);
 *    here, a POSIX home's user name is still the part after its last `/`.
