 * Reading what the overseer said.
 *
 * The reply is asked for as one JSON object carrying `say` and an optional
 * action. When the model does something else, the old code handed the raw
 * string through as the message, so the chat showed
 * `"action": {"kind": "message_agent", "agent_id": "57f0c6ff-...", "text"` as
 * if that were the answer. Every path here has to end in something readable.
