/**
 * An agent whose record has no `skills` array could not start, at all.
 *
 * `AgentStatus.skills` is typed as required, so nothing warned, but the field is
 * only written by builds that had it: a file from an older version, a hand edit,
 * or a restored backup arrives without it. `agent:start` passes `agent.skills`
 * straight into `getPtyEnvVars`, and every one of the fifteen providers opens by
 * joining it, so the whole call threw
 *
 *     TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'join')
 *
 * The user saw nothing except an agent that refused to run, with the reason
 * buried in a rejected IPC call. Found by launching the packaged 1.6.0 against a
 * seeded home directory.
 *
 * `output` had the identical shape of problem and was fixed in loadAgents with a
 * comment describing it; `skills` two lines away was left out. That habit is why
 * this test covers every provider rather than the one that was reported.
