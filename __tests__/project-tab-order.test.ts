 * The order of the project tabs.

 * A stored order is a preference, not a list of what exists: agents come and
 * go, so the ranking will always be partly stale. The rule that has to hold is
 * that it never decides which projects appear. A project the user has never
 * dragged must still show up, and a project whose last agent was removed must
 * not linger as a tab pointing at nothing.
