/**
 * Whether an agent's last session can actually be resumed.
 *
 * `claude --resume <id>` reads the conversation back from
 * `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-path>/<id>.jsonl`. If that file is not there,
 * the binary exits with an error instead of starting, so an agent whose
 * transcript has been cleaned up would simply stop launching. Restarting into
 * a fresh conversation is a worse outcome than resuming and a much better one
 * than not starting at all, so the id is only ever used once the file backing
 * it has been found.
 *
 * The project directory name is Claude Code's own encoding: every `/` and `.`
 * in the path becomes `-` (see decode-project-path.ts, which reverses it).
 * Encoding is lossy, so several paths can encode to the same directory name;
 * that is fine here, because the session id is a UUID and the check is only
 * asking whether this exact transcript exists.
