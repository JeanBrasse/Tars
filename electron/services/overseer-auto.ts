/**
 * The narrow set of things the overseer may do without asking.
 *
 * The write gate does not move: nothing reaches a CLI except through
 * `confirmPendingAction`, and it still rejects malformed actions and replays.
 * A rule here decides that a particular proposal counts as already approved,
 * and every rule has to earn that by being specific about the state it applies
 * to. Anything a rule does not match still waits for Noah, which is every
 * proposal by default: the list starts empty.
 *
 * Two things every rule must respect, because they are correctness rather than
 * taste:
 *
 * - **Never write to a running agent.** Typing into a session mid-task
 *   interleaves with what it is doing.
 * - **Never write to one blocked on a permission dialog.** That dialog wants
 *   arrow keys, and the delayed carriage return Tars sends could accept the
 *   permission it is asking about. `/dispatch` refuses this too; a rule must
 *   not be the thing that gets around it.
 *
 * An automatic send is never silent: the message in the chat says which rule
 * sent it, so a rule doing the wrong thing is visible rather than inferred.
