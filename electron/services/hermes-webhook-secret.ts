/**
 * The Hermes webhook secret: the one credential Tars hands to something off
 * this machine, and the only one that opens `POST /api/webhooks/hermes`.
 *
 * Through that route Hermes dispatches to any agent of any project, named by
 * id or by name, because a cron job goes wherever Noah points it. That is the
 * reach of Noah's own chat, so the secret is kept where his conversation is
 * kept, in the directory no agent is handed.
 *
 * It was minted into `~/.dorothy`, which every agent is started with, one
 * `cat` away. The lot that stopped the shared token from driving agents left
 * this one there, and the audit of that lot found the webhook still taking the
 * shared token as well: refusing the one and leaving the other in the agents'
 * directory would only have changed which file an agent reads to drive the
 * fleet. It moves at startup with its value unchanged, so the Hermes jobs that
 * hold it keep working. An agent that read it before the move still has it:
 * rotating it is deleting the private file, opening Settings > Hermes for a
 * new one, and giving Hermes that.
 *
 * What the move is not: an agent that goes looking for the private directory
 * still reads it, as it reads Noah's conversation there. See SECURITY.md.
