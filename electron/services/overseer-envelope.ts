// ── Reading a reply ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The envelope the header of overseer.ts describes, what a reply that is only
// its template looks like, and when two replies say the same thing.

/**
 * The same observation, told again.
 *
 * The guard before this one tested a shape of text, and shapes are what a
 * model varies. What went wrong twice is a behaviour: the overseer saying what
 * it just said, being shown that it said it, and saying it again. So the test
 * is about sameness.
 *
 * It used to allow a small edit budget on top, which sounds harmless and was
 * not. Five percent of a sentence only exceeds three characters past sixty
 * normalised characters, so in practice the rule was "identical give or take
 * three", and three characters is the whole difference between "Agent a1
 * errored" and "Agent a2 errored". Two agents failing one after the other, and
 * the second one silently dropped. That is the same class of harm as the loop
 * itself: something true, gone, with nobody told.
 *
 * There is no budget any more. Two tellings are the same telling when they are
 * the same words, and the only thing normalised away is an elapsed duration,
 * because "waiting for eleven minutes" and "waiting for 12 minutes" are one
 * observation getting older. A number that is not counting a duration is left
 * exactly as written: it is naming something. "Two agents" and "Nine agents"
 * are different facts, and so are a1 and a2.
 *
 * A repeat that has been reworded gets through, and that is the right way to
 * be wrong. A duplicate that slips past costs one line; a real observation
 * merged into a previous one costs the observation. The fold in
 * serializeHistory and the instruction in composeTurn carry that half.

/**
 * A reply that is the format example rather than an answer.
 *
 * The prompt shows Hermes the envelope to fill in. When it copies the example
 * instead of filling it, the result is still valid JSON, so parseEnvelope
 * accepts it and `say` becomes the placeholder itself. That happened once on
 * Noah's install and then never stopped: every following turn was shown the
 * placeholder as something the overseer had already said, and copied it in
 * turn. Nineteen consecutive turns, none of which could recover on its own.
 *
 * Two tests, both exact, neither with a number in it to get wrong.
 *
 * The first is the tokens this app has itself put in front of the model. We
 * know them exactly, so a reply carrying one verbatim is an echo and there is
 * nothing to estimate. This is what catches a reply that wraps the template in
 * a word or two, which the second test alone lets through: harmless as a
 * displayed message, but serializeHistory asks the same question, so letting
 * one back into the prompt is the loop starting again.
 *
 * The second is structural, for shapes we have never emitted, such as the
 * gateway's own `[SILENT]`. Take out the placeholder spans and bare sentinel
 * tokens, and see whether any message is left. Prose that merely happens to
 * contain angle brackets keeps its words; a reply built only of placeholders
 * has nothing left.
