 * path on its File objects), and an agent needs a path it can read. So the
 * bytes are written here, under ~/.dorothy, which is in every agent's
 * `--add-dir`, one folder per file so two files of the same name never meet,
 * and the message that sends them names each by its absolute path. Staged in
 * memory until a message takes them: a staged file nobody sends stays on disk
 * with the others, and is never named to anyone.
