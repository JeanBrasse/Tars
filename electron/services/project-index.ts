/**
 * The project folders a CLI keeps (`~/.claude/projects` and the like), with the
 * path each stands for, read without blocking the main process. Decoding a
 * folder name is what costs (Claude Code writes `/` and `.` as `-`, so the
 * decoder tries separators against the disk): 101 ms on Noah's 27 folders,
 * paid again by four IPC callers on every call, 104 to 397 ms each (the Audit,
 * 2026-09-23). A path is decoded once and kept, and again only when it no
 * longer exists, at most every REDECODE_MS: a directory that appeared later
 * then gets its real path, and a deleted project costs a decode twice a minute.
