/**
 * The Orchestrator toggle is the role.
 *
 * There used to be two switches. `role` made an agent its project's
 * orchestrator: the orchestration instructions, no editing tools, the global
 * room of the Chat, Telegram and Slack. Nothing in the interface set it: it
 * was read from the name ("orchestrator" or "super agent" in it), at creation,
 * at every rename and on load. The toggle, `orchestratorMode`, only took the
 * editing tools away, which every launch path already did for an
 * orchestrator. So the toggle changed nothing for the orchestrators, gave a
 * worker a restriction without the instructions that go with it, and renaming
 * "Tars-Orchestrator" to "Tars-Lead" would have demoted it without a word.
 * Audited on 2026-09-22; Noah decided the same evening that the toggle is the
 * role, the name decides nothing, and a project has one orchestrator.
 *
 * `orchestratorMode` stays on the record, always equal to the role, because
 * the renderer still reads it to draw the toggle and sends it back on every
 * save, until it reads `role`. A create or an update that names `role` is read
 * by it; one that only sends `orchestratorMode` is read as the toggle's old
 * name for the same thing.
