 *
 * Asleep: `status` is `asleep` from `asleepSince`, no terminal, its
 * conversation kept for the next start, which resumes it whatever started the
 * agent earlier in this run. The last screen of the CLI it slept in is kept
 * here, in memory, for its pane: the terminal and its mirror are gone, and the
 * screen is what a person reads to know where it was.
 *
 * Woken: every way an agent gets a terminal again (initAgentPty for the window,
 * the bots and the launches of the main process; spawnAgentSession for the
 * API) calls `wakeFromSleep`, so no sender can wake it without it reading
 * `waking`, with who woke it and how, until its CLI's session is up. The
 * sender says who it is with `noteWaker` before it starts the agent; one that
 * says nothing wakes it as Tars.
