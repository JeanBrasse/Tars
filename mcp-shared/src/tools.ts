/**
 * How the MCP servers answer a tools/call, and how they register their tools:
 * a table per server, one row per tool. A row is what tools/list shows (name,
 * description, schema) and what the tool does; registerTools runs every row
 * inside the one guard that turns a throw into the tool's
 * "Error <failure>: <message>", where each tool used to carry a try/catch.
 *
 * Neither the SDK nor zod is imported (see tars-api.ts): each server brings
 * its own. A schema is read only through what its fields parse to, the
 * `_output` zod 3 and zod 4 both declare.
