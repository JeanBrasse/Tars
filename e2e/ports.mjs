/**
 * The ports an E2E run takes, and where its artefacts go.
 *
 * Every port moves together by E2E_PORT_OFFSET: `next dev` listens on
 * 3100 + offset and each suite's app on its own API port + offset. Two runs
 * on the same machine, each with its own offset, never meet; with the
 * variable unset, nothing moves from the ports the suites always had. An
 * offset that is not a whole number is refused rather than read as 0, which
 * would put the run on another run's ports.
 *
 * Read by playwright.config.ts, the global setup and every spec, so the
 * server the config starts and the URL the specs open are the same one.
